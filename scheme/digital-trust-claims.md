# Digital Trust Claims

## What is a Digital Trust Claim?
A digital trust claim is an assertion regarding the trustworthiness of a digital system, process, service, product, or entity based on defined criteria, such as security, privacy, or data integrity.

### Extending the ISO/IEC 17029 Validation and Verification Model
Under ISO/IEC 17029, which provides general principles and requirements for validation and verification (V&V) bodies, such claims undergo systematic assessment to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and conformance to specified standards. In this context, validation confirms the plausibility of a digital trust claim before implementation, while verification evaluates whether the claim has been fulfilled after implementation. This process strengthens confidence in digital ecosystems by providing independent, standards-based assurance.

### How Digital Trust Claims are Different

A digital trust claim differs from a standardized validation and verification (V&V) claim in scope, context, and assessment criteria. Traditional V&V claims, as outlined in ISO/IEC 17029, focus on verifying compliance with established standards, regulations, or technical specifications â€” ensuring that a product, process, or system meets predefined, measurable requirements. These claims are often domain-specific and structured within well-documented conformity assessment frameworks.

In contrast, a digital trust claim extends beyond strict regulatory or technical compliance. It encompasses broader trustworthiness attributes, such as security, privacy, transparency, and ethical considerations, which may not always have universally agreed-upon verification criteria. While validation and verification still apply, assessing a digital trust claim often requires a more context-driven, risk-based approach that considers stakeholder expectations, evolving technology landscapes, and open-source development principles. This makes digital trust claims more dynamic and multidimensional compared to traditional V&V claims.

## Standard Practice for Digital Trust Claims and Supporting Information
This document outlines the standard practice for developing and declaring digital trust claims. The standard practice is designed to ensure that digital trust claims made by organizations align consistently with a set of principles, providing interested parties with confidence in the accuracy and reliability of these claims. It uses ISO/TS 17033 Ethical Claims and Supporting Information as reference.

## Principles
The principles described below provide the basis for digital trust claims to be made.

### Reliability
Digital trust claims are accurate, factual and verifiable.
Trust is a prerequisite for digital trust claims to be accepted as genuine by prospective users. As such, digital trust claims are based on substantiated evidence and are unlikely to result in misinterpretation. Digital trust claims are robust and consistent to help users make informed decisions.

### Transparency
Digital trust claims are supported by information concerning the procedure, methodology, and any criteria and assumptions that is publicly available and readily accessible. 
There is adequate information that is updated in a timely manner to enable users to make informed decisions. 

### Relevance
Digital trust claims consider the relevant aspects of the evolving technology landscape and reflect applicable codes of good practice.
Digital trust claims stay consistent across all instances where they are made, although they can be adapted where necessary to local conditions. They are reassessed and updated as necessary to reflect changes in technology or other circumstances that can affect the accuracy of the claim.

## Scope of Digital Trust Claims
The scope of the digital trust claim:
1)	Accurately reflects the issue of trustworthiness based on defined criteria, such as security, privacy, or data integrity;
2)	Identifies all aspects of the digital system, process, service, product, or entity that the assertion relates to;
3)	Identifies relevant aspects of the digital system, process, service, product, or entity that will not be included in the digital trust claim. Scope limitations are stated each time the digital trust claim is made.
