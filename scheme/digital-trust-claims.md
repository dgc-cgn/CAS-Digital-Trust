## What is a Digital Trust Claim?

### Extending the ISO 17029 Validation and Verification Model

A digital trust claim is a statement asserting the trustworthiness of a digital system, process, or entity based on defined criteria, such as security, privacy, or data integrity. Under ISO/IEC 17029, which provides general principles and requirements for validation and verification (V&V) bodies, such claims undergo systematic assessment to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and conformance to specified standards. In this context, validation confirms the soundness of a digital trust claim before implementation, while verification evaluates whether the claim has been fulfilled based on objective evidence. This process strengthens confidence in digital ecosystems by providing independent, standards-based assurance.

### How Digital Claims are different

A digital trust claim differs from a standardized validation and verification (V&V) claim in scope, context, and assessment criteria. Traditional V&V claims, as outlined in ISO/IEC 17029, focus on verifying compliance with established standards, regulations, or technical specificationsâ€”ensuring that a product, process, or system meets predefined, measurable requirements. These claims are often domain-specific and structured within well-documented conformity assessment frameworks.

In contrast, a digital trust claim extends beyond strict regulatory or technical compliance. It encompasses broader trustworthiness attributes, such as security, privacy, transparency, and ethical considerations, which may not always have universally agreed-upon verification criteria. While validation and verification still apply, assessing a digital trust claim often requires a more context-driven, risk-based approach that considers stakeholder expectations, evolving technology landscapes, and open-source development principles. This makes digital trust claims more dynamic and multidimensional compared to traditional V&V claims.
