## Background Material

### Strategic Need

The role of data stewardship has become a central issue in the evolution of modern markets, politics, and nearly every other aspect of public life. As a result, there is a significant amount of emergent opportunity, risk, and instability posed by competing efforts to define data stewardship as a practice – both in terms of its core functions and ethical standards. In the absence of consensus approaches to data stewardship standards, a range of governments and enterprise are, largely unilaterally, inventing their own practice – often in ways that project or benefit their competitive, political, or moral interests. These competing efforts are at the root of a number of civil and economic, though increasingly military, conflicts – splintering access to services and the physical infrastructure of the digital world. The standards development process offers an uncommon opportunity to debate and build consensus around the functional and ethical standards for data stewardship, not as an imperative for innovation – but rooted in an immediate need for critical infrastructure to stabilize current practice.

There are at least three, driving needs for data stewardship standards: (1) professionalization; (2) de-politicization; and (3) harmonization. Nearly every industry in the world has made major investments in digital transformation – whether through adaptation of their own services, adoption of data-driven approaches to key informatics functions, or engagement in data brokerage directly. Each of these industries have pre-existing norms, standards, and rights – all of which digital practice affects and, ideally, translates into improved approaches. Yet, most digital systems lack the process transparency,participation tools, or apportioned equity to meaningfully understand the effect of digital transformation. Data stewardship standards not only help articulate professional data management and governance standards across disciplines, but they also help frame new markets and opportunities to create professional services. Data management and stewardship services aren’t, of course, new – but they are still difficult to compare and, as data architectures become increasingly political,
fragmented.

Data stewardship practice is also hard to establish, because the definitions of data stewardship practice has become extremely politicized. Technology companies and markets are, as a result, increasingly dominated by the presumption of complicity with the interests of their founding nation. In some instances, this is offered as a positive, where markets with progressive political speech, labor, or environmental laws position their regulatory regime and/or values ‘as-a-service’ to non-residents. In contrast, those same presumptions can be used as arguments for data localization and protectionism – largely as a proxy for unstated standards of practice. Even beyond national law, as technology companies develop new practices to address data stewardship issues, they are often evaluated based on the popular perception of the company, as opposed to the merits of the approach. Without objective industry standards, it will be nearly impossible to extricate politics from the 
professionalization of data stewardship. 

Data stewardship standards, both as a development process and as a legitimately agreed output, are a critical and overdue foundation for the ongoing digital transformation of industry and institutions, 
globally

### Trade

The effect of politics is already evident in the ways that technology markets have started to fragment along jurisdictional lines – threatening one of the digital world’s greatest values: a global resource. Data stewardship, whether taking place inside of the financial industry, in political engagement, or even military operations, is a critical layer of the relationships between immensely important actors. And, just as with other cross-cutting instruments of global governance, the practice of data stewardship requires a dedicated institutional mechanism for negotiating, deciding, and enforcing standards of practice, in addition to contextual standards of practice. These standards are critical for stability – but also for the continued project of economic globalism. In the absence of dedicated and global standards, domestic policy issues will continue to provoke unilateral stances on technology issues that would be better resolved through a governance process. Data stewardship standards willrequire a governance process that addresses those needs and – as seeing through international harmonization around data privacy law – preserve access to global digital markets.
