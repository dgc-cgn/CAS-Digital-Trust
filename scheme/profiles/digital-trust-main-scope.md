# Digital Trust

## Introduction

Digital trust refers to the confidence that people have in the security, reliability, and integrity of digital systems, devices, and services and these are built and maintained in a fair, open and transparent manner. Digital Trust is an important concept in the digital age, as more and more aspects of our lives are mediated by technology and the internet.

Digital trust is overall expectation that digital technologies and services, including the organizations that provide these technologies and services will protect all stakeholdersâ€™ interests and uphold societal expectations and values.

There are numerous factors that contribute to digital trust, including the security of digital systems and devices, the privacy and confidentiality of personal information, the reliability and availability of digital services, and the transparency and accountability of the organizations that provide them. Building and maintaining digital trust requires ongoing efforts to protect against cyber threats, ensure the privacy and security of personal information, and be transparent and accountable in the use of digital technologies.

In order for individuals and organizations to feel confident in using digital systems and services, it is important for these systems to be secure, reliable, and trustworthy. This requires ongoing efforts to protect against cyber threats, ensure the privacy and security of personal information, and be transparent and accountable in the use of digital technologies.

## Digital Trust Certification

Digital trust certification is more than just an outcome of a certification process, or a mark of trustworthiness. It is a demonstration that certain standards or criteria have been met in the context of being recoginized as a reputable actor within the digital realm. Consideration of the digital realm is important because it can extend and have effect across many legal and political jurisidictions having varying levels of regulation and enforcement. Digital trust certification is intended to complement existing certification schemes by taking into the account the evolving nature of the digital realm including: codes of practice, new requirements, normative principles and emerging practices.

The figure, below, illustrates how things fit together:

## Digital Trust Principles

Using the broadest brush, digital trust is based on a common foundation of principles. In a digital world, individuals must be able to trust that their privacy is protected, that their data will not be misused, and that enitities communicate in a simple and straightforward manner with their users.

As a starting point, the digital trust certification program would abide by 10 principles tailored from [Canada's Digital Charter](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/062.nsf/%20eng/h_00108.html):

1. Universal Access
2. Safety and Security
3. Control and Consent
4. Transparency, Portability and Interoperability
5. Open and Modern Digital Government (Governance)
6. A Level Playing Field
7. Data and Digital for Good
8. Strong Democracy
9. Free from Hate and Violent Extremism
10. Strong Enforcement and Accountability

## Digital Trust Interoperability

Digital trust interoperability refers to the ability of different organizations, programs, systems and technologies to work together in a way that allows people to decide to trust and rely on the information and services provided by those systems. Depending on the context, this can involve a variety of different components, such as ensuring that different systems use common standards and protocols for exchanging data, that there are clear and transparent processes in place for verifying the accuracy and reliability of the information being shared, and that there are measures in place to protect privacy and security.

Digital trust interoperability is important because it helps to ensure that different organizations and systems can work together effectively and that people can rely on the information and services that they provide.

## Digital Trust Conformity Assessment Scheme

The Digital Trust conformity assessment scheme is intended to facilitate trust interoperablity in the digital world - or digital trust interoperabilty - as described in the previous section. To achieve this, the conformity assessment scheme incorporates certification sub-scopes and specializations that fit under a single umbrella - digital trust.

* For suppliers, the digital trust scheme can be used to showcase their compliance to one or more recognized standards, certifications, accreditations, audit programs, and best practices.

* For purchasers, the digital trust scheme can be used assist in the overall digital ecosystem performance and procurement efficiency by quickly and easily identifying organizations that commit to standards, certifications and trust signals that are important to them.

## Complementing Trust Frameworks

A trust framework is a set of guidelines, principles, and standards that are used to establish and maintain trust between different parties. Trust frameworks can be used in a variety of contexts, such as between businesses, between organizations and their customers, or between government agencies and the public.

Similarly, a conformity assessment scheme is a set of procedures, standards, and guidelines that are used to evaluate whether a product, service, or system meets certain specified requirements or standards.

In many ways, trust frameworks and conformity assessment schemes can be seen as the same things - there are overlaps, but there are key differences:

Conformity assessment schemes are oriented toward *outputs*, while trrust frameworks are oriented more towards *outcomes*. Outputs refer to the products, services, or other tangible results that are generated by a system or process. Outcomes, on the other hand, refer to the broader effects or consequences of a system or process.

While there is no hard and fast distinction, outputs gengerally refer to tangible results of products and services. Outcomes typically refer to results that are intangible or long-term in nature and are more difficult a to measure and quantify.

The Digital Trust conformity assessment scheme is intended to support existing and emerging trust frameworks. Trust frameworks over time may evolve into standards and conformity assessment schemes as is case of the [Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework](https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/Version1_4) which forms the basis of [Trusted Digital Identity Profile](./digital-identity-profile.md)

## Assessment Class Level

A **assesment class level** refers to the relative effort or thoroughness required to arrive at appropriately-founded conclusions. Depending on the class level, different methodologies and techniques may be employed. The reason for the different levels is to facilitate an objectively appropriate approach based on key factors, which have been identified as organizational size and risk level (note: these factors may expand as the conformity assessment scheme evolves)

* **Class 1: Attestation Method -**  Assessment method is carried out with respect to the client attesting to its expected role, obligations and behaviours within a trusted digital ecosystem. This is similar to treating the client organization as a black box, focusing on the characteristics which interact and have impact on other actors in the digital ecosystem.
* **Class 2: Targeted Method -** Assessment method is carried out with respect to the overall client system that includes prioritized selected controls. Summary evidence is evaluated for the selected controls
* **Class 3: Substantive Method -** Assessment method is carried out on controls and procedures that are identified as substantive part of the system. Detailed evidence is evaluated for the substantive controls.
* **Class 4: Comprehensive Method -** Assessment method is carried out on all controls and procedures including those controls and procedures may be part of supporting and/or oversight functions. Detailed evidence is evaluated for all controls.

Presently, two main factors have been identified to determine the **Assessment Class Level** (described in following section):

* Entity Type
* Risk Impact Level

### Entity Class

The class of entity in relation to the digital trust ecosystem:

* **Participant Entity** an actor who is an ordinary participant in the ecosystem
* **Significant Entity** an actor having significant influence in the ecosystem
* **Auhtoritative Entity** an actor having authority (e.g., government)

For the purposes of the conformity assessment scheme, **number of employees** is used as the key metric.

### Risk Impact Categories

Risk levels refer to the likelihood or probability of a particular event or outcome occurring that is attributable to the service or program under assessment. Risk impact categories helto to determine the relative importance or severity of the risk beyond an individual actor and to guide decision-making and risk management activities.

* **Limited Impact** The risk may impact the actor and its direct relationshsips only.
* **Broader Impact** The risk may impact beyond the actor, to others having an indirect relationship or to a broader network or community.
* **Systemic Impact** The risk may impact the entire system rather than individual actors, networks or communities within the system.

### Determing Assessment Class Level

The following table provides a mapping to determine the assessment class level

|Entity Class / Risk Impact Category|Limited Impact|Broader Impact|Systemic|
|---|---|---|---|
|Participant Entity |Class 1|Class 2|Class 3|
|Significant Entity|Class 2|Class 3|Class 4|
|Authoritative Entity |Class 3|Class 4|Class 4|

### Tailoring Digital Trust Assessments

There is no 'one-fits-all approach'. In scoping out a digital trust assessment, the following steps are undertaken

|Component|Certification Considerations|
|---|---|
|Main Scope|No Tailoring: Digital Trust in all cases.|
|Sub-Scope|Addition of Domain|Tailoring based on practices, codes, etc., accepted within the domain|
|Specialization|Restriction of scope to a specifialization within a domain|
|Class Level| Method tailoring based on **Assessment Class Level**|
|Caveats|Any caveats resulting from the preceding|
