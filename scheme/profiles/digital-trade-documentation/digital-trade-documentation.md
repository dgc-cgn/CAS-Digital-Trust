# Scheme Name: Digital Trade Documentation

## Introduction

Digital Trade Documentation refers to the various types of records that are generated and exchanged during the process of international trade. These documents are essential for facilitating and regulating the movement of goods and services across borders and ensuring that transactions are conducted legally and efficiently. Trade documentation serves several important purposes, including:

* **Legal Compliance:** Trade documents help ensure that international trade transactions comply with the laws and regulations of the countries involved. They provide evidence of the legality of the trade and help prevent smuggling, fraud, and other illegal activities.

* **Customs Clearance:** Customs authorities in importing and exporting countries require trade documents to assess and collect duties and taxes, verify the value and origin of goods, and ensure that the goods meet all regulatory requirements. Proper documentation is crucial for smooth customs clearance.

* **Payment and Finance:** Trade documents are often used in financial transactions. Banks and financial institutions may require certain documents, such as bills of lading and letters of credit, to facilitate payment between the parties involved in the trade.

* **Risk Mitigation:** Trade documents can help mitigate risks associated with international trade. For example, a letter of credit issued by a bank can provide assurance to the exporter that they will be paid, even if the importer defaults.

* **Record-Keeping:** Trade documentation serves as a historical record of a trade transaction. This can be important for auditing purposes, resolving disputes, and tracking the movement of goods.

Common types of trade documentation include:

* **Commercial Invoice:** A document issued by the seller to the buyer that provides a detailed breakdown of the goods sold, their quantity, price, and other relevant information.

* **Bill of Lading:** A transport document issued by a carrier or their agent that acknowledges the receipt of goods for shipment and specifies the terms of transportation.

* **Packing List:** A document that lists the contents of a shipment, including details about packaging, weights, and dimensions.

* **Certificate of Origin:** A document that certifies the country of origin of the goods. It may be required for customs clearance and to determine eligibility for preferential trade agreements.

* **Letter of Credit:** A financial document issued by a bank that guarantees payment to the seller upon the presentation of certain documents and compliance with the terms and conditions specified in the letter of credit.

* **Insurance Certificate:** A document that provides evidence of insurance coverage for the goods during transit.

* **Customs Declaration:** A form that provides information about the goods being imported or exported, including their value, classification, and other details required by customs authorities.

The specific trade documents required can vary depending on the nature of the goods, the countries involved, and the terms of the trade agreement. It's essential for businesses engaged in international trade to understand and properly manage trade documentation to ensure the smooth flow of goods and compliance with regulations.

## From Paper to Electronic to Digital

For millenia, **paper** has been the standard substrate for trade, signed in wet ink by an authority. The next phase was **electronic** which were initially paper substitutes, evolving to **structured data** that forms the basis of most trade documentation today. The next phase is toward **authentic structured data**, cryptographically signed data that is independently verifiable across the many trust domains of digital trade.

The **legal aspect** is supported by [UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records](https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records) defining the functional equivalence of paper predecessors and the reliability of systems to safeguard the integrity of trade documentation.

The **technical aspect** is supported by an emerging ecosystem of interoperable systems having technical standardization at many layers.

Today, and into the future, **digital** will become the standard substrate standard for trade, vastly superior to paper, by means of cryptographic techniques that guarantee the integrity of documentation.
