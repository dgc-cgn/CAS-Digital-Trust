# Assessment Class Level

A **assesment class level** refers to the relative effort or thoroughness required to arrive at appropriately-founded conclusions. Depending on the class level, different methodologies and techniques may be employed. The reason for the different levels is to facilitate an objectively appropriate approach based on key factors, which have been identified as organizational size and risk level (note: these factors may expand as the conformity assessment scheme evolves)

* **Class 1: Attestation Method -**  Assessment method is carried out with respect to the client attesting to its expected role, obligations and behaviours within a trusted digital ecosystem. This is similar to treating the client organization as a black box, focusing on the characteristics which interact and have impact on other actors in the digital ecosystem.
* **Class 2: Targeted Method -** Assessment method is carried out with respect to the overall client system that includes prioritized selected controls. Summary evidence is evaluated for the selected controls
* **Class 3: Substantive Method -** Assessment method is carried out on controls and procedures that are identified as substantive part of the system. Detailed evidence is evaluated for the substantive controls.
* **Class 4: Comprehensive Method -** Assessment method is carried out on all controls and procedures including those controls and procedures may be part of supporting and/or oversight functions. Detailed evidence is evaluated for all controls.

Presently, two main factors have been identified to determine the **Assessment Class Level** (described in following section):

* Entity Type
* Risk Impact Level

## Entity Class

The class of entity in relation to the digital trust ecosystem:

* **Participant Entity** an actor who is an ordinary participant in the ecosystem
* **Significant Entity** an actor having significant influence in the ecosystem
* **Authoritative Entity** an actor having authority (e.g., government)

For the purposes of the conformity assessment scheme, **number of employees** may be used as the key metric.

## Risk Impact Categories

Risk levels refer to the likelihood or probability of a particular event or outcome occurring that is attributable to the service or program under assessment. Risk impact categories helto to determine the relative importance or severity of the risk beyond an individual actor and to guide decision-making and risk management activities.

* **Limited Impact** The risk may impact the actor and its direct relationshsips only.
* **Broader Impact** The risk may impact beyond the actor, to others having an indirect relationship or to a broader network or community.
* **Systemic Impact** The risk may impact the entire system rather than individual actors, networks or communities within the system.

## Determing Assessment Class Level

The following table provides a mapping to determine the assessment class level

|Entity Class / Risk Impact Category|Limited Impact|Broader Impact|Systemic|
|---|---|---|---|
|Participant Entity |Class 1|Class 2|Class 3|
|Significant Entity|Class 2|Class 3|Class 4|
|Authoritative Entity |Class 3|Class 4|Class 4|
