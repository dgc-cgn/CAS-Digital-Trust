## Assessment Class Levels

A **assesment class level** refers to the relative effort or thoroughness required to arrive at appropriately-founded conclusions. Depending on the class level, different methodologies and techniques may be employed. The reason for the different levels is to facilitate an objectively appropriate approach based on key factors, which have been identified as organizational size and risk level (note: these factors may expand as the conformity assessment scheme evolves)

* **Class 1: Attestation Method -**  Assessment method is carried out with respect to the client attesting to its expected role, obligations and behaviours within a trusted digital ecosystem. This is similar to treating the client organization as a black box, focusing on the characteristics which interact and have impact on other actors in the digital ecosystem.
* **Class 2: Targeted Method -** Assessment method is carried out with respect to the overall client system that includes prioritized selected controls. Summary evidence is evaluated for the selected controls
* **Class 3: Substantive Method -** Assessment method is carried out on controls and procedures that are identified as substantive part of the system. Detailed evidence is evaluated for the substantive controls.
* **Class 4: Comprehensive Method -** Assessment method is carried out on all controls and procedures including those controls and procedures may be part of supporting and/or oversight functions. Detailed evidence is evaluated for all controls.

## Mapping to 17000 Levels of Assurance

The concept of "level of assurance" in the context of ISO/IEC 17029 refers to the degree of confidence in a claim being validated or verified. This level of assurance can be defined in various programs with different conditions to achieve specific assurance levels, such as "absolute," "reasonable," or "limited" assurance​​.

In the framework of ISO/IEC 17000, which is related to the demonstration that specified requirements are fulfilled, the conformity assessment process is described as encompassing three functions: selection, determination, and review and attestation. Validation and verification, as part of the conformity assessment, include making a decision on the confirmation of the claim. This involves determining whether the claim conforms with the initially specified requirements, leading to the issuance of a validation or verification statement by the body responsible for these processes. The program involved can specify additional steps within the validation or verification process, including defining the level of assurance​​.

Each level reflects a different degree of rigor in the assessment process and the confidence that stakeholders can place in the results. However, for precise definitions and applications of these levels within the context of a specific program or project, one would need to refer to the program's guidelines or standards.

* **Limited Assurance:** This level generally indicates a lower level of scrutiny and examination, suggesting that the validation or verification process was less rigorous. The conclusions drawn are therefore correspondingly less definitive.
* **Reasonable Assurance:** This level typically implies a more thorough examination process, offering a higher degree of confidence in the validation or verification outcomes, although not absolute.
* **Absolute Assurance:** Although not typically used in practice due to the inherent limitations of any assessment process, this level would suggest an extremely high level of scrutiny and confidence in the results, signifying that the validation or verification process was as exhaustive as possible.

The following table shows the mapping:

|Assessment Class Level|Level of Assurance|
|---|---|
|Class 1: Attestation Method|Limited|
|Class 2: Targeted Method|Reasonable|
|Class 3: Substantive Method|Reasonable|
|Class 4: Comprehensive Method|Absolute|

## Assessment Factors

Presently, two main factors have been identified to determine the **Assessment Class Level** (described in following section):

* Entity Type
* Risk Impact Level

## Entity Class

The class of entity in relation to the digital trust ecosystem:

* **Participant Entity** an actor who is an ordinary participant in the ecosystem
* **Significant Entity** an actor having significant influence in the ecosystem
* **Authoritative Entity** an actor having authority (e.g., government)

For the purposes of the conformity assessment scheme, **number of employees** may be used as the key metric.

## Risk Impact Categories

Risk levels refer to the likelihood or probability of a particular event or outcome occurring that is attributable to the service or program under assessment. Risk impact categories helto to determine the relative importance or severity of the risk beyond an individual actor and to guide decision-making and risk management activities.

* **Limited Impact** The risk may impact the actor and its direct relationshsips only.
* **Broader Impact** The risk may impact beyond the actor, to others having an indirect relationship or to a broader network or community.
* **Systemic Impact** The risk may impact the entire system rather than individual actors, networks or communities within the system.

## Determing Assessment Class Level

The following table provides a mapping to determine the assessment class level

|Entity Class / Risk Impact Category|Limited Impact|Broader Impact|Systemic|
|---|---|---|---|
|Participant Entity |Class 1|Class 2|Class 3|
|Significant Entity|Class 2|Class 3|Class 4|
|Authoritative Entity |Class 3|Class 4|Class 4|

*The time required of an organization can vary; on average, organizations allow for a couple of weeks to gather necessary documentation for a review. However, this timeframe can be shorter depending on the organization’s readiness.
