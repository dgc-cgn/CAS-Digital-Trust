# Data Governance

## Sub-Scope

Data governance is the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an organization. It involves establishing policies, procedures, and standards for the collection, storage, use, and dissemination of data, as well as the roles and responsibilities of individuals and groups within the organization with regard to these activities.

Data governance aims to ensure that data is collected, used, and shared in a way that is consistent with the organization's goals and values, and that complies with relevant laws and regulations. It also involves establishing processes for monitoring and enforcing compliance with data governance policies, as well as for addressing any issues that may arise.

Effective data governance is important for organizations of all sizes, as it helps to ensure that data is used in a responsible and ethical manner, and helps to protect the privacy and security of individuals whose data is being collected and used.

This profile sets out the fundamental characteristics and attributes required of data protection systems. It includes measures to protect data while it is being held on a server and while it is being transferred between IT systems and/or organizations.

## Data-Centric Security

There is a growing need to protect confidential and sensitive data of critical sectors, relating to government, prime contractors, suppliers, personally identifiable information, client trade secrets, details on mergers and acquisitions, media assets, designs, Intellectual Property, which if it falls in the wrong hands can be detrimental to the organization. With existing and upcoming new regulations, in many cases the onus to keep information secure weighs increasingly on organizations themselves, as a data breach potentially leads to high financial penalties. Aside from regulation penalties, other associated risks with data breaches include, high cost of notification of data breach, allocation of resources to contain damage, reputation risk, litigation risk, market value risk.

Data-Centric Security focuses on protecting the data itself—through encryption, access controls, and monitoring—rather than relying solely on securing the systems or networks where the data resides.
