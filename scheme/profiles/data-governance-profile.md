# Data Governance

## Sub-Scope

Data governance is the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data used in an organization. It involves establishing policies, procedures, and standards for the collection, storage, use, and dissemination of data, as well as the roles and responsibilities of individuals and groups within the organization with regard to these activities.

Data governance aims to ensure that data is collected, used, and shared in a way that is consistent with the organization's goals and values, and that complies with relevant laws and regulations. It also involves establishing processes for monitoring and enforcing compliance with data governance policies, as well as for addressing any issues that may arise.

Effective data governance is important for organizations of all sizes, as it helps to ensure that data is used in a responsible and ethical manner, and helps to protect the privacy and security of individuals whose data is being collected and used.
