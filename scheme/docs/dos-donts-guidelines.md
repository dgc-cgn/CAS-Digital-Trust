# Do's and Don't's of Conformity Assessment

The document "Do's and Don'ts - Conformity Assessment for Standards Writers" outlines several important guidelines for those involved in drafting documents related to conformity assessment. Here are some key points:

## Do's

- **Ensure Neutrality:** Documents should be written in a way that allows conformity assessment by a manufacturer, a user, or an independent body, adhering to the "neutrality principle."

- **Incorporate Key Words Carefully:** Terms like accreditation, certification, testing, etc., should be used thoughtfully, as they have conformity assessment implications.

- **Reference Existing Standards:** Make normative references to relevant published ISO/IEC documents for conformity assessment procedures.

- **Clarity in Specifying Requirements:** Requirements should be clear, direct, precise, and result in uniform interpretation.

- **Independent Application of Separate Parts:** If a document specifies additional conformity assessment requirements, they should be in a separate document or part that can be applied independently.

## Don'ts

- Avoid Bias Towards a Specific Assessment Type: The content should not show a preference for a particular form or type of assessment.

- No Requirements for Quality Management Systems: Standards should not make conformity dependent on a quality management systems standard, such as ISO 9001.

- Avoid Over-Complexity in Test Methods: Test methods should be effective, economical, and practically applicable, without unnecessary complexity.
