# Accreditation

## What is accreditation?

It is important that the market has assurance that conformity assessment bodies (CABs) themselves operate to acceptable standards and this is the purpose of accreditation. The accreditation process determines, in the public interest, the technical competence and integrity of organisations such as those offering testing, calibration and certification services (commonly referred to as conformity assessment).
Benefits of accreditation

Accreditation assures governments, businesses and end users that Conformity Assessment Bodies have the required competence and impartiality to fulfill their role as evidenced by the fulfillment of specific accreditation requirements. Accreditation operates across all market sectors and provides an impartial assessment against nationally and internationally recognised standards. This has benefits for several groups.

### Government

Accreditation provides confidence in the competence and consistency of conformity assessment activities that can be used to support the implementation of government policies and regulations that impact on health, welfare, security and the environment.

### Industry

Accredited conformity assessment is essential for decision-making and risk management. Organisations can save time and money by selecting accredited and therefore competent conformity assessment services.
Accredited conformity assessment can provide a competitive advantage and facilitates access to export markets – with the aim of ‘tested or certified once, accepted everywhere.’
Accurate measurements and tests carried out in compliance with best practice have the potential to limit product failure, control manufacturing costs and foster innovation.

### Accredited organizations

Accreditation provides objective evidence that conformity assessment organisations conform with recognised standards. It is the internationally recognised system that is used to develop and sustain high standards of performance.

### Consumers

Accredited conformity assessment gives consumers confidence through ensuring consistently high standards in the quality of products or services purchased.

## Accreditation policy principles

The principles are as follows:

* Accreditation is applicable to both the regulated and non-regulated sectors.
* Accreditation being at the topmost level of control should provide an authoritative statement of the technical competence of CABs.
* Accreditation is considered to be a public authority activity and should therefore operate in the public interest. It should be self-supporting but run as a not for profit activity.
* Accreditation should be operated with integrity; independent of the organisations it accredits and impartial, and free from commercial pressure. The CAB shall operate to recognised standards or other transparent criteria and be compliant with applicabletechnical requirements, demonstrated, where appropriate, through peer evaluation.
