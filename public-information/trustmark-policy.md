# Trustmark Policy

## What is a Trustmark?

A trustmark is a graphical representation of a grant resulting from the succesful outcome of a conformity assessment or verification process.

The trustmark is a visible indicator that signifies adherence to specific standards of trustworthiness that a product, service, or organization meets a certain level of quality or compliance with best practices.

A trustmark instills confidence among consumers or users, indicating that the marked entity is reliable, secure, or respects user privacy.

Trustmarks are often used in contexts such as online security, data protection, e-commerce, and sustainable business practices.

## 1. Eligibility and Authorization

- Only entities that have been formally assessed and certified by DGC are eligible to use the trustmark.
- The trustmark may only be used in connection with the services or products for which it was awarded.

## 2. Display Guidelines

- The trustmark should be displayed prominently on websites, digital platforms, or product packaging where it is clearly visible to users or consumers.
- Alteration or modification of the trustmark’s design, color, or proportions is strictly prohibited.

## 3. Usage Period

- The trustmark is valid for a period specified by DGC, after which re-assessment is required for continued use.
- In the event of expiration, the entity must cease the use of the trustmark immediately until renewal is granted.

## 4. Compliance and Monitoring

- Entities must continue to comply with the standards and criteria set by DGC during the period of trustmark usage.
- DGC reserves the right to conduct periodic audits to ensure ongoing compliance.

## 5. Misuse and Violation

- Misrepresentation of compliance or misuse of the trustmark, such as displaying it after expiration or revocation, will lead to immediate withdrawal of the trustmark and possible legal action.
- Entities found in violation may be subject to penalties, including but not limited to, fines and public notification of non-compliance.

## 6. Revocation of Authorization

- DGC reserves the right to revoke the trustmark at any time if the entity fails to comply with the set standards or breaches any terms of this policy.

## 7. Liability

- The trustmark is provided 'as is' and DGC makes no warranties regarding the trustmark’s impact on the entity’s business or reputation.
- DGC shall not be liable for any damages or claims arising out of the use or misuse of the trustmark.

## 8. Policy Amendments

- DGC reserves the right to amend this policy at any time. Entities are responsible for staying informed about policy changes, which will be communicated through official channels.
