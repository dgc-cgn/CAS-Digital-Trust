# Conformity Assessment Principles

Developed in accordance with **ISO/IEC GUIDE 60:2004 Conformity assessment — Code of Good Practice**

## Introduction

Conformity assessment entails activities aimed at demonstrating that products, processes, systems, individuals, or organizations meet defined prerequisites. Conformity assessments encompass varying approaches that offer different levels of assurance, affirming that products, systems, processes, individuals, or bodies comply with criteria established in specifications, which may originate from international, regional, or national standards, guidelines, or other normative documents.

The swift advancement of technology, fusion of economic and production mechanisms, and heightened international trade underscore the necessity for uniformity in conformity assessment processes and systems. Harmonized international standards are progressively recognized as an efficacious means to enhance competition and eradicate technical impediments to trade. Nonetheless, the implementation of harmonized international protocols is not as evolved in the domain of conformity assessment, wherein disparate practices and methodologies still prevail. This circumstance could lead to supplementary costs for manufacturers, exporters, and consumers, and presents obstacles for regulatory bodies and industries across all nations, including those in development.

The development of international, regional, and private-sector conformity assessment systems and schemes merits attention. These systems persistently grow, fostering confidence among users of conformity assessment services—including industry professionals, regulators, and consumers—and advocating global acceptance through various methods. Furthermore, the utilization of declarations of conformity (DoCs) has maintained an upward trajectory in numerous product domains.

Different conformity assessment procedures and requirements, coupled with the absence of recognition for assessment results, can restrict the trade of goods and services. It is imperative that endeavors are undertaken to ensure all conformity assessment systems and procedures seek the involvement of all pertinent parties, operate non-discriminatorily, uphold transparency, and evade needless barriers to trade. Those within the conformity assessment community are urged to contribute to the development of international standards and guides, employ them as the foundation for their respective assessment activities and systems, and partake in information sharing and confidence-boosting efforts to amplify understanding and acceptance of alternate systems and methodologies.

## Principles

### Principle 1: Conformity assessment normative documents

Conformity assessment normative documents (e.g. standards, guides and procedures) used by conformity
assessment bodies and accreditation bodies to carry out their work and activities should

* be prepared in a transparent, open, impartial and coherent manner,
* respond appropriately to regulatory and market needs,
* be technically relevant,
* address, where appropriate, the technical competence of relevant bodies,
* avoid unnecessary obstacles to trade and reflect the principles of non-discrimination and national treatment,
*)where appropriate, be written to be used directly in first-party, second-party and third-party conformity assessment, and
* take into account issues related to the participation of, and use by, developing countries.

### Principle 2: Conformity Assessment Activities

All organizations involved in conformity assessment activities, including conformity assessment bodies and
accreditation bodies, should

* base their activities as far as possible on international standards and guides developed by consensus,
such as ISO/IEC International Standards and Guides,
* be managed and operated to give the sufficient level of assurance of the conformity of products,processes, systems, persons or bodies with specified requirements,
* protect all confidential information,
* conduct their activities with professional integrity, in an ethical and non-discriminatory manner and avoid
conflicts of interests,
* process applications and assessments in a prompt, impartial and efficient manner and ensure that anticipated timeframes are communicated to the client,
* process complaints or appeals (where applicable) in a prompt, impartial and efficient manner, and take corrective action when justified,
* prepare proper records of conformity assessment activities and maintain these records for a period consistent with the body’s contractual and legal obligations; these records should include adequate documentation for any determination of denial, withdrawal, suspension or termination of the authorization to use evidence of conformity,
* maintain and make readily available information on all services offered and related fees, as well as information on certificates held or granted, scopes of accreditation, etc.,
* be subject to monitoring procedures (as appropriate),
* demonstrate their competence by a suitable mechanism (e.g. accreditation, peer assessment),
* provide an adequate written report of a conformity assessment procedure which highlights, where applicable, any nonconformities or necessary corrective actions,
* ensure, where a mark is utilized, that the rules or conditions related to the use of the mark are applied to guard against any misuse, and
* take into account issues related to the participation of, and use by, developing countries.

### Principle 3: Conformity assessment systems and schemes

Conformity assessment systems and schemes should

* be operated by a body or bodies adhering to the principles outlined in the previous principle,
* be designed and administered in a transparent, open, non-discriminatory and reliable manner,
* be designed and administered in such a way as to not create unnecessary obstacles to trade,
* be appropriate to the particular situation or industry sector in order to facilitate acceptance of the conformity assessment results,
* be governed by rules and procedures that are documented and available to interested parties in a reasonable and timely manner upon request, and that specify elements including
  * criteria and processes for access to the system or scheme,
  * how documentation is to be controlled,
  * specifications and/or standards upon which the system or scheme is based,
  * how demonstration of conformity is to be achieved and maintained,
  * how evidence of conformity is to be documented,
  * how integrity, impartiality and competence is to be maintained,
  * identifiable, realistic and readily available mechanisms for the impartial handling of any substantive and procedural appeal or complaint, and
* take into account issues related to the participation of, and use by, developing countries.

### Principle 4: Conformity assessment results

Conformity assessment results (assessment reports, test reports, declarations, certificates, marks, etc.)
should

* be clear, unambiguous, easily understood and not designed to mislead in any way,
* identify the specified requirements (e.g. standards, guides, regulations or technical specifications) against which the conformity assessment activity has been made, the applicable scope of the assessment and how the results are assured (e.g. through accreditation, formal recognition and peer assessment),
* be accurately maintained by the conformity assessment body, system or scheme and, while maintaining the confidentiality of the information, be made available upon request, and
* be comparable to facilitate recognition or acceptance.
