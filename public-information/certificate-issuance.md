All audit reports (Stage 1, Stage 2, routine surveillances, follow-up, special audit, recertification etc) are reviewed at multiple stages.  

* The audit reports are reviewed at multiple stages.  


* **Stage 1** includes administrative review. The submitted set of documents is reviewed for completion (also called administrative review) by AE. Audit report review checklist (F34) is used to record the review. AE issues a deviation note against the team leader (F35 Deviation note) if they find one while administration review.  AE submits findings to Director Ops.

* **Stage 2** includes technical review. The audit report (corrected if possible) along with audit report review checklist (F34) is submitted to Certification committee member for technical review which includes review of the information provided by the audit team is sufficient with respect to certification requirements, scope of accreditation and effectiveness of corrections and corrective actions are effective for all non-conformances raised during the audit. Stage 2 shall be carried out by the auditor qualified for the specific sector, provided they have not participated in the audit and has not declared any conflict w.r.t. the client. The person responsible for technical review is identified during the contract review (F085). It is the responsibility of the auditor to pro-actively declare of any conflict. The technical review may lead to a deviation note (F35), which is issued against the team leader, if a deviation is found. All auditors are trained for the review process. In cases where technical expert is used for the audit, the technical reviewer may discuss with the technical expert on the NC / observations used. The reviewer may also discuss any particular part of the report with the team leader / specific auditor. The reviewer also identifies if correction to deviation note (F35) issued needs to be completed prior to Stage 3. In case the audit report does not require review by certification committee chairman, the report is returned to AE for Stage 4.

Any audit report requiring issue of certificate (Stage 2 audit, change in scope or address, triennial audit etc) requires review and approval by certification committee chairman. For routine surveillance, the review by certification committee chairman is not required. The technical reviewer shall decide whether the report needs submission to certification committee chairman. Certification committee chairman reviews the findings of Stage 1 and 2 in addition to review of audit report prior to taking the decision. Correspondence related to the client ( e.g. Complaints received against the client, changes in scope, media reports etc) are also reviewed during recertification decision.  The decision taken is recorded on F34 form. For stage 1 audit, the stage 2 audit may be planned after technical review, however the certification committee chairman shall review the stage 1 audit report along with stage 2 audit before making a decision. The certification committee may ask for specific inputs from the client or send any auditor to the client to verify any part of the report. 

In case Certification committee chairman is involved in the audit or is not available or has declared conflict w.r.t. any client, any other director reviews the audit report and takes the decision. The change is recorded on F34 form.

If the client does not reply in fourteen days, if the reply is not satisfactory, or if the actions required are not effectively completed in the allowed time, the Quality Manager determines whether to suspend or cancel certification. 

If the decision is made to cancel certification, the MD is responsible for suspending the client or canceling the client from the Register of Approved Firms, advising the client by registered mail / courier, and publicizing the cancellation, if necessary. MD cannot over-rule the decision made by Director Ops. 

The following reasons are considered grounds for suspension or cancellation:

The routine surveillance is carried out not more than 12 months from the last audit. In case the audit is not done within 12 months (13 months in case of yearly surveillance), the certificate is suspended and a letter is sent to the client requesting him to agree for the audit. In case of a delay up to 3 months (15 months from the last audit), the audit time shall be extended by 50% of the routine surveillance time (at least 1 day). Successful completion of the audit within 15 months shall not impact the certification.

## Conditions for Suspension or Cancellation of Client Certification1 

Subject to actions by the client, the following steps will be taken leading to possible suspension or cancellation of the client's certification:  

Unless a reply is received to the letter accompanying notification within 14 days, certification will be suspended and a notification of suspension may be published at the discretion of DGC 

The client's response to the accompanying letter will be reviewed and the proceedings may be put on hold while clarification is sought. 

Where mutually agreed-upon corrective action is to be implemented, a time period for implementation will be specified and a review of the corrective action undertaken at the appointed time. This may be the subject of a special surveillance visit or of review of submitted objective evidence, at the discretion of DGC Should the corrective action not be considered adequate or not be completed by the appointed time, certification will be automatically suspended. 

In the case of serious circumstances, DGC may invoke suspension during the period pending the implementation of corrective action. 

Where suspension has been invoked, unless otherwise specified, the client must advise DGC every 14 days of the current situation of corrective action. Failure to meet this requirement will result in cancellation of the client's certification. 

Where suspension has been invoked due to failure to conduct surveillance audit, the client shall give justification for failure and offer suitable date. An additional day shall be added to routine surveillance days. The date shall not be later than 15 months from last audit. Failure to offer for audit within 15 months shall result in cancellation of certification. 

When corrective action to resolve the problem(s) taken by the client has been verified, certification will be resumed. The period of certification will not be revised to cover the period of suspension. 

Cancellation of certification will be invoked where, following suspension of certification, the client fails to respond to DGC communications within the 14-day grace period or fails to implement corrective action within the appointed time period. 

In extreme circumstances DGC may invoke the cancellation of certification with immediate effect without recourse to initial certification suspension. 

Cancellation of certification will require the client to assume the status of non-approval and return all certification documentation to DGC
