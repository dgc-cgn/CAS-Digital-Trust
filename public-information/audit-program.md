# DGC Audit Program

## Overview

The audit program followed by DGC includes a two–stage initial audit, surveillance audits in the first and second years, and a re–certification audit in the third year prior to expiration of certification. The three year certification cycle begins with the certification or recertification decision. The determination of the audit program and any subsequent adjustments are based on the size of the client organization, the scope, and complexity of its management system, products and processes as well as demonstrated level of management system effectiveness and the results of any previous audits. During preparation of audit plan, followings may be taken in to consideration when developing or revising an audit program, they might also need to be addressed when determining the audit scope and developing the audit plan; 

* complaints received about the client; 
* combined, integrated or joint audit;
* changes to the certification requirements;
* changes to legal requirements; 
* changes to accreditation requirements; 
* organizational performance data (e.g. defect levels, key performance indicators  data); 
* relevant interested parties’ concerns. 


Surveillance audits are conducted at least once a calendar year, except in recertification years. Care is taken and ensures that the date of the first surveillance audit following initial certification should not be more than 12 months from the certification decision date. 

Where the DGC is taking account of certification already granted to the client and to audits performed by another certification body, it obtains and retain sufficient evidence, such as reports and documentation on corrective actions, to any nonconformity. It is ensured that the documentation support the fulfilling of the requirements in this part of ISO/IEC 17021–1:2015. DGC shall, based on the information obtained, justify and record any adjustments to the existing audit program and follow up the implementation of corrective actions concerning previous nonconformities.
